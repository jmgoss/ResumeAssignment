          <h3> Think Big Conference Logo </h3>
        
          <p> This project required the students to design a logo that could be used for the entirety of a fictional conference given to us. The logo was designed to show the importance of growth of ideas and creativity. This project was broken into many steps to ensure that the students used elements of color, white space, and overall craftsmanship to create the best logo possible for this assignment.

          <h3> Found Type Poster </h3>

          <p>This assignment asked the students to use outside resources to create a poster for a local band of their choice. I used many albums, magazines, and newspaper to design a poster for the band, “The Arson Daily”. The design reflects the artist’s style and music so that it can draw in potential listeners.</p>

          <h3> Dynamic Illustration </h3>
  
          <p>This is a simple illustration that was done using Adobe Illustrator to recreate the look of a real life painting. This was assigned to me as I got started using Adobe Illustrator to enhance my skills with the pen tool and understand color blocking at a deeper level.</p>
